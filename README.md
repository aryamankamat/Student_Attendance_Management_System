# Student_Attendance_Management_System
Frontend: The frontend of your project is written in Python using the tkinter module. This module allows you to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The GUI of your project allows users to register their faces, view their attendance records, and export their attendance records to a CSV file.
Backend: The backend of your project is written in Python using the MySQL workbench. This database management system allows you to store data in a relational database. The backend of your project stores the following data:
# Student ID
# Student name
# Student face image
# Student attendance records
Face recognition module: The face recognition module of your project uses the LBPH face recognition algorithm. This algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to identify faces. The face recognition module of your project captures the faces of students and trains a model using the LBPH algorithm. The model is then used to identify students and mark their attendance.
Here are some of the benefits of using your project:
# Accurate attendance tracking: The face recognition module of your project can accurately identify students, which ensures that attendance is tracked accurately.
# Reduced workload for teachers: The face recognition module of your project can automatically mark attendance, which reduces the workload for teachers.
# Improved security: The face recognition module of your project can be used to control access to restricted areas.
